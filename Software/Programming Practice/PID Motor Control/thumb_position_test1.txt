** This test runs THUMB FROM fully extended position TO fully contracted position twice and back,
	given the current setup (single-jointed thumb).
** Even though values are printing for the structure named "Pointer", the motor was running the thumb appendage for this test.
** "Frequency of incoming signal" is frequency of encoder signals (3 rising edges per 1 rotation of encoder wheel).
** Values print every 1000 ms via a delay in the main loop.
